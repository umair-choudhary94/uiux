                    <h5>What is Lorem Ipsum?<h5>
                    <p><small>
                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                         when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a 
                         type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
                         leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
                         It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
                         containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
                         software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</small></p>
                    <h5>Why do we use it?<h5>
                    <p><small>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
                        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using 
                        Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as 
                        opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable 
                        English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem 
                        Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will 
                        uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved 
                        over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour 
                        and the like).</small></p>
                    <h5>Where does it come from?<h5>
                    <p><small>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has 
                        roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 
                        2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
                        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
                        consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the 
                        word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum 
                        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
                        (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a 
                        treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
                        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a 
                        line in section 1.10.32.</small></p>
